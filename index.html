	  Machine Learning to improve chip-design 
	  convergence, Physical Design fundamental algorithms
	  and optimization techniques. <br />
	  
	  Today, an Integrated Chip design (encompassing logic synthesis, placement, routing and optimization) involves optimization/analysis over billions of 
	  variables (physical and electrical components) interweaved  with complex objective functions (wirelength, power, performance and area). 
	  The Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry offers many state-of-the-art optimization and analysis tools that help in reaching our goal to design and manufacture a chip. 
	  All of these tools (developed for over 30 years) suffer from their inability to learn from their past behavior. So, any small change in the problem needs a completely new start.
	  Also, to reduce the space of solutions (usually exponential), multiple heuristics and meta-heuristics are used; with the eventual goal being, faster convergence of the algorithm. 
	  These choices of heuristics could result in sub-optimal solution. 
	    
	  Exploration-explotation entwined with learning optimal sequences of decisions is the key paridigm of reinforcement learning. With the latest GPUs with 1000s of logic cores,
	  handling large datasets, and training is not a bottleneck anymore. Formulating complex problems as learning problems can leverage the computation captablity, that these special
	    logic cores offer. 
	  learn these optimal sequences of decisions is 
	    My research during my Ph.D is towards this pursuit.
	  Since majority of the problems in chip-design-cycle can be formulated as optimization over directed acyclic graphs, my research is projected towards using a combination of graph embeddings using neural networks
	  and reinforcement learning. 
	 
    
	  <H3>Biographical Sketch</H3>
	  I received my Dual Degree (Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical 
	  and Electronics Engg & Masters in Physics) from BITS-Pilani in 
	  2011. I am currently a third year Computer Engineering Ph.D. student at University of California
	  San Diego, advised by Prof. C. K. Cheng (Distinguished Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and an Adjunct Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UCSD). Before joining UCSD for his Ph.D., I worked as a chip design engineer
	  in India for over six years. </p>
