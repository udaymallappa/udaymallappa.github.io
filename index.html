	  <H3>Research Interests (AI for Design Optimization and Efficient ASIC Design for AI Algorithms)</H3>
	  "Integrated Circuit Design and Artificial Intelligence: A Paradigm Shift in Electronic Design Automation":

The modern integrated chip (IC) design process—spanning logic synthesis, placement, routing, and optimization—requires managing billions of interconnected variables (physical and electrical components) while optimizing for multifaceted objectives such as wirelength, power, performance, and area. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art tools in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry struggle with a significant limitation: they lack the ability to learn from past iterations. As a result, even minor problem variations demand a complete restart, leading to inefficiencies.

To expedite convergence in these inherently complex, exponential solution spaces, heuristics and meta-heuristics are employed. While effective, these methods often yield suboptimal results due to their reliance on pre-defined rules rather than adaptive learning.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a transformative paradigm by intertwining exploration, exploitation, and decision-making with learning. Recent advancements in GPU technology, providing thousands of computational cores, have eliminated bottlenecks in exploring and training over large datasets. By reframing chip design optimization challenges as learning problems, we can leverage GPUs’ computational power to address these challenges more effectively.

My research focuses on harnessing graph neural networks for embedding directed acyclic graphs (a fundamental representation in chip design) and coupling them with RL to learn optimal decision sequences. This work has been a cornerstone of my Ph.D. and represents a step towards smarter, adaptive design methodologies.

To complement this exploration, I have delved into efficient ML accelerator design. This work involves developing hardware-friendly inference algorithms, conducting software-architecture co-design, and tackling low-level implementation challenges, including Verilog design, physical layout (placement, routing, power delivery network synthesis, timing, and power analysis), and chip tape-out at 40nm. This journey, initially driven by curiosity, has helped me integrate and apply the diverse skills I’ve developed over the last decade, demonstrating their collective impact in advancing cutting-edge chip design.
    
	  <H3>Biographical Sketch</H3>
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, from University of California, San Diego. Prior to this, I obtained a Dual Degree (B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and M.Sc. in Physics) from BITS Pilani in 2011. 
Currently, I am a Research Scientist at Intel AI labs.  </p>
